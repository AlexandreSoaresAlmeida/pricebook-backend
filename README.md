Technologies:

| Technologies | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| Springboot | Spring Boot is a Spring project that came to facilitate the process of configuring and publishing our applications. The intention is to have your project running as fast as possible and without complications. |
| JPA/Hibernate | Hibernate is the most used data persistence framework in Java projects. JPA is the Java specification that dictates how ORM frameworks should be implemented. |
| REST | REST, short for "REpresentational State Transfer", is not a technology, a library, nor an architecture, but rather a model to be used to design distributed software architectures, based on network communication.
| JWT | JWT is an industry standard (RFC-7519) that defines how to transmit and store JSON objects in a compact and secure way between different applications. The data it contains can be validated at any time as the token is digitally signed. |
| S3 | Amazon Simple Storage Service, known as Amazon S3, is a web-based object storage service for storing and retrieving any volume of data.
